# [E-commerce Back End](https://github.com/domdecap/ecommerce-back-end)



## Description

This is a working backend for an e-commerce website. It is written to utilize Sequelize for the route notation.

## Technologies

I used JavaScript, Node, pg, npm, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, and Insomnia.

## Install

Prerequisites: [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en) ```v20.12.2```
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) ```v16.2```

1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Open in code editior (I used VS Code).
3. Open a new instance of the integrated terminal.
4. Run ```npm i``` to install dependencies.
5. Log in to PostgreSQL by typing ```psql -U postgres``` and entering your password.
6. Run ```\i db/schema.sql``` to create the database and tables.
7. Close out of Postgres console.
8. Open new console.
9. Run ```node seeds/index``` to seed the tables.

## Usage

After following installation instructions, run ```node server``` in the integrated terminal to launch the employee tracker. From there, you should be able to check that all of the routes are function properly by checking them in Insomnia. View Demo video to see them in action.

## Contributions

I received help from my tutor Mampuru on how to fix my Create Product route. I utilized ChatGPT to help create and debug the routes.
